The story of the re-discovered LEGO<sup>&reg;</sup> that turns into a passion should sound familiar to a lot of people reading this. First, trying to complete the childhood sets from the attic, then starting to add to the collection, and before long, trying to decide which room in the house will be the LEGO<sup>&reg;</sup> room.

*"Could we add sound to my carousel, like the Grand Carousel?"* - This simple question, combined with an electronics hobby, got the ball rolling and quickly snowballed into what became the [Scene Master][scenemaster]. Soon after, while getting a tour of a friend's MÃ¤rklin<sup>&reg;</sup> railway landscape, the idea of the [Servo Switch][servoswitch] was born.

After talking to many fellow builders at LEGO<sup>&reg;</sup> events, it became obvious that there are a lot of ideas out there worth exploring. Many creative minds are better than one, so AntTronics was created as a place for a community to share, explore and eventually develop ideas that can help bring our models to life.

They say the best tool for a job is the tool you are most familiar with. Coming from software development background, [Github][repositories] seems like the obvious choice for such a collaborative effort. It has all of the necessary tools, such as discussions, wikis, issue tracking etc, as well as a place to publish and share the results.

Most of the action will be taking place there and these pages will be mainly used as a [directory][projects] for the different ideas, as well as a place to [showcase][showcase] the results.
