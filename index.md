The story of the re-discovered LEGO<sup>&reg;</sup> that turns into a passion should sound familiar to a lot of people who happen to be reading this. First, trying to complete the childhood sets from the attic, then starting to add to the collection, and before long, trying to decide which room in the house will be the LEGO<sup>&reg;</sup> room.

One day, a simple question along the lines of "Could we add sound to my carousel, like the Grand Carousel?" got the ball rolling and quickly snowballed into what became the [SceneMaster](./scenemaster). 

Soon after, while getting a tour of a friend's MÃ¤rklin<sup>&reg;</sup> railway landscape, the idea of the [ServoSwitch](./servoswitch) was born and after talking to many fellow builders at LEGO<sup>&reg;</sup> events, it became obvious that there are a lot of ideas out there worth exploring.

It was obvious form the start that many creative minds are better than one (or in our case, two) and so AntTronics was born. A place for a community to share, explore and eventually develop ideas that can help bring our models to life.
