This is the first entry in the news section, where future announcements will appear, but it's not just a placeholder. This is to announce our first project to be uploaded on [Github][solartrackersensor_repo], the [Solar Tracker Sensor][solartrackersensor]. A simple sensor circuit that uses photo-transistors and boolean logic to indicate if a solar panel is pointing straight at the sun.
